## Setup

> If you want to commit and push your work as you go, you'll want to
> [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
> first and then clone your fork rather than this repo directly.

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals.git
cd react-fundamentals
node setup
```

This may take a few minutes. **It will ask you for your email.** This is
optional and just automatically adds your email to the links in the project to
make filling out some forms easier.

A few common issues during `node setup` have involved PATH variables (above
links or [here](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals/issues/27)),
reinstalling git, node, or npm, and clearing npm caches.

If you get any errors, please read through them and see if you can find out what
the problem is. If you can't work it out on your own then please [file an
issue][issue] and provide _all_ the output from the commands you ran (even if
it's a lot).

If you can't get the setup script to work, then just make sure you have the
right versions of the requirements listed above, and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run validate
```

It's recommended you run everything locally in the same environment you work in
every day, but if you're having issues getting things set up, you can also set
this up using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
([video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCoVJm3hGk4)) or
[Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/kentcdodds/react-fundamentals).

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
```

This should start up your browser. If you're familiar, this is a standard
[react-scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/) application.

You can also open
[the deployment of the app on Netlify](https://react-fundamentals.netlify.app/).

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in watch mode. Read the output and
play around with it. The tests are there to help you reach the final version,
however _sometimes_ you can accomplish the task and the tests still fail if you
implement things differently than I do in my solution, so don't look to them as
a complete authority.

### Exercises

- `src/exercise/00.md`: Background, Exercise Instructions, Extra Credit
- `src/exercise/00.js`: Exercise with Emoji helpers
- `src/__tests__/00.js`: Tests
- `src/final/00.js`: Final version
- `src/final/00.extra-0.js`: Final version of extra credit

The purpose of the exercise is **not** for you to work through all the material.
It's intended to get your brain thinking about the right questions to ask me as
_I_ walk through the material.
